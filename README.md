## üìù  Description


AirRemote is a solution designed to modernize legacy remote-controlled devices by making them smart and remotely accessible. AirRemote operates as a universal remote emulator. It works by capturing the infrared (IR) signals from any remote control‚Äîregardless of how rare or obscure‚Äîand storing them for later use. You can then replay those commands remotely through the web interface (or through automated routines) enabling you to perform actions such as open the A/C or your heater on your way back, finding your house in the perfect temperature when you arrive, or just keep all your remotes in one place without needing to search for them every time.

## üîß Features 
- Record the IR signals by simply pressing the buttons of their existing remote control onto the AirRemote device.
- Replay the stored signals on command via a web interface.
- Create automations to perform a set of operations (such as open lighting, A/C etc.) at specific times.
- Give the device to a friend, with the capability to initialize the device and provide credentials through a Captive Portal interface.
- Manage, Delete, Reorder your favourite devices through the web interface.

With these capabilities, AirRemote turns virtually any device with an IR remote into a smart, remotely controllable appliance.

## üåü Project Overview

The **AirRemote** project is divided into three main components. Each part contains instructions on how to deploy / install it:

- [**Embedded Device (This Repository):**](https://github.com/jugeekuz/AirRemote-Embedded) 
    - A C/C++ PlatformIO project, involving ESP32-based unit with an IR receiver and 8 powerful IR blasters. It records IR signals from any remote control and replays them across the room, enabling universal compatibility.
    
- [**Serverless Backend:**](https://github.com/jugeekuz/AirRemote-Backend) 
    - A Python project using Serverless framework to deploy a scalable AWS-based backend powered by Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway, and EventBridge. It ensures secure command storage, user authorization, and efficient routing between the web interface and devices.

- [**Frontend:**](https://github.com/jugeekuz/AirRemote-Frontend) 
    - A React JS project providing an application for managing devices, saving IR commands, authenticating users and creating powerful automation routines‚Äîall accessible through a sleek web interface.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and deployment
### üì¶ Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have npm 10.0+ installed.
    ```bash
    npm -v
    ```

2. Make sure you have [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) installed and configured:
    ```bash
    aws --v
    aws s3 ls
    ```

### üöÄ Deployment to AWS

1. #### Create S3 Bucket
    ```bash
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <your-bucket-name> --region <your-region-id> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<your-region-id>
    ```
3. #### Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jugeekuz/AirRemote-Frontend
    ```
4. #### Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5. #### Add .env file 
    - Copy the `.env` file produced from the deployment of the [*Serverless Backend*](https://github.com/jugeekuz/AirRemote-Backend) to the root directory of this project (if you don't have it yet you can add it later and redeploy).

6. #### Build the production build of the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
7. #### Upload your files
    ```bash
    aws s3 sync ./dist s3://<your-bucket-name>
    ```
8. #### Enable Static Website Hosting
    ```bash
    aws s3 website s3://your-bucket-name/ --index-document index.html --error-document index.html
    ```

9. #### Configure Route 53
    1. Create a Hosted Zone (Change `unique-string` to some unique value):
        ```bash
        aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name <hosted-zone-name> --caller-reference unique-string
        ```

    2. Retrieve the NameServers and update them in your domain registrar (verify that the name server change took place using a whois service).

10. #### Request an SSL Certificate using AWS ACM
    - Request a Certificate (region has to be `us-east-1`) and keep the CertificateArn output:
        ```bash
        aws acm request-certificate --domain-name <your-domain-name> --validation-method DNS --region us-east-1
        ```

11.  #### Create DNS validation records in Route 53
    1. Retrieve the necessary CNAME entries from ACM (use the `CertificateArn` from previous step):
        ```bash
        aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <your-certificate-arn> --region us-east-1
        ```

    2. Save the following config in `tmp/acm_validation_config.json` (replace <CNAME_name_from_acm> and <CNAME_value_from_acm> w/ the values retrieved from the output of previous command under `ResourceRecord`) :
        ```json
        {
            "Changes": [
                {
                    "Action": "UPSERT",
                    "ResourceRecordSet": {
                        "Name": "<CNAME_name_from_acm>" ,
                        "Type": "CNAME",
                        "TTL": 300,
                        "ResourceRecords": [{"Value": "<CNAME_value_from_acm>"}]
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    3. Add the CNAME record to Route 53 (replace the `HOSTED_ZONE_ID` w/ value from step 3.1):
        ```bash
        aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id <HOSTED_ZONE_ID> --change-batch file://tmp/acm_validation_config.json
        ```

12. #### Verify ACM Certificate Validation Status
    After some time, verify that the ACM Certificate `Status` is `ISSUED` and `ValidationStatus` is `SUCCESS`. Give it some time if it isn't (it could take up to an hour).
    ```bash
    aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn <your-certificate-arn> --region us-east-1
    ```

13. #### Create CloudFront distribution
    1. Create an Origin Access Control and save it to `tmp/origin_access_control_config.json`
        ```json
        {
            "Name": "air-remote-access-control",
            "Description": "OAC for AirRemote bucket",
            "SigningProtocol": "sigv4",
            "SigningBehavior": "always",
            "OriginAccessControlOriginType": "s3"
        }
        ```
    
    2. Publish it and retrieve the Id that is displayed in the response
        ```bash
        aws cloudfront create-origin-access-control --origin-access-control-config file://tmp/origin_access_control_config.json
        ```

    3. Create a caching policy and save it to `tmp/caching_policy.json`
        ```json
        {
            "Name": "AirRemoteCustomCachePolicy",
            "DefaultTTL": 86400,
            "MinTTL": 0,
            "MaxTTL": 31536000,
            "ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin": {
                "EnableAcceptEncodingGzip": true,
                "EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli": true,
                "HeadersConfig": {
                    "HeaderBehavior": "none"
                },
                "CookiesConfig": {
                    "CookieBehavior": "all"
                },
                "QueryStringsConfig": {
                    "QueryStringBehavior": "all"
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    4. Publish the cache policy and retrieve the Id in the response to use on the next step.
        ```bash
        aws cloudfront create-cache-policy --cache-policy-config file://tmp/caching_policy.json
        ```

    5. Create the distribution config and save it to `tmp/cloudfront_distribution_config.json` and replace `<your-domain>`, `<ORIGIN-ACCESS-CONTROL-ID>`, `<CACHE_POLICY_ID>` and `<ACM_CERTIFICATE_ARN>` with your values retrieved from previous steps.
        ```json
        {
            "CallerReference": "'CLOUDFRONT_AIRREMOTE_DISTRIBUTION'",
            "Comment": "Air Remote CloudFront Distribution",
            "Enabled": true,

                    "ErrorCachingMinTTL": 300
                    },
                    {
                    "ErrorCode": 404,
                    "ResponsePagePath": "/index.html",
                    "ResponseCode": "200",
                    "ErrorCachingMinTTL": 300
                    }
                ]
            },
            "HttpVersion": "http2",

            "DefaultRootObject": "index.html",
            "WebACLId": ""
        }
        ```
    6. Create the distribution:
        ```bash
        aws cloudfront create-distribution --distribution-config file://tmp/cloudfront_distribution_config.json
        ```

14. #### Create S3 bucket policy
    1. Create the following bucket policy in `tmp/s3_bucket_policy.json` and replace w/ values from previous steps.
        ```json
        {
            "Version": "2008-10-17",
            "Id": "PolicyForCloudFrontPrivateContent",
            "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipal",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Principal": {
                    "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
                },
                "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-domain>/*",
                "Condition": {
                    "StringEquals": {
                        "AWS:SourceArn": "<CLOUDFRONT_ARN>"
                    }
                }        
            }
            ]
        }
        ```

    2. Attach the policy to S3
        ```bash
        aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket <your-domain> --policy file://tmp/s3_bucket_policy.json
        ```

15. #### Map Domain Name to Cloudfront distribution
    1. Get the Cloudfront distribution URL and Route 53 Hosted Zone Id through the following commands (present in `DomainName` / `Id` ):
        ```bash
        aws cloudfront list-distributions
        aws route53 list-hosted-zones
        ```

    2. Create a file `tmp/route_53_record.json` and paste the following:
        ```json
        {
            "Comment": "A record for CloudFront distribution",
            "Changes": [
                {
                    "Action": "UPSERT",
                    "ResourceRecordSet": {
                        "Name": "<your-domain>",
                        "Type": "A",
                        "AliasTarget": {
                            "HostedZoneId": "Z2FDTNDATAQYW2",
                            "DNSName": "<CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN_NAME>",
                            "EvaluateTargetHealth": false
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

    3. Apply the change through the CLI:
        ```bash
        aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id "<HOSTED-ZONE-ID>" --change-batch file://tmp/route_53_record.json
        ```

    4. Verify that the change took place by checking if `Status` is `INSYNC` (change `<CHANGE_ID>` with the output of the previous command)
        ```bash
        aws route53 get-change --id <CHANGE_ID>
        ```
16. #### Provide API endpoints obtained from backend deployment
    1. If you haven't already, deploy the [AirRemote Backend](https://github.com/jugeekuz/AirRemote-Backend).

    2. In the `/output` folder of the serverless project (after deployment) there will be a `.env` file containing the API endpoints. Copy it to the root directory of this project.

    3. Rebuild the project:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```

    4. Redeploy to AWS S3:
        ```bash
        aws s3 sync ./dist s3://<your-bucket-name>
        ```

    5. Create a cache invalidation for the cache to be purged in CloudFront:
        ```bash
        aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID> --paths "/*"
        ```
